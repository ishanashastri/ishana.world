        <div class="about"> 
            I am a rising sophomore at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with an intended double major in
            computer science and mathematics.<br>
            <br>
            A 2019 graduate from Poolesville High School's Science, Math, and Computer Science magnet program,
            I am interested in applying computer science to solve global issues, with a recent focus on machine
            learning research. I am currently working on <b>theoretical machine learning</b> at MIT's Center for Brains,
            Minds, and Machines. I have previously worked on <b>unsupervised 3D mesh segmentation</b> at IBM Research, 
            high-throughput omics for <b>cardiovascular disease progression</b> at Fondazione Bruno Kessler in Trento,
            Italy, and the <b>detection of tumors</b> in mammograms at the George Washington University in Washington, 
            D.C. In the future, I hope to expand my scope of work to include <b>robotics and energy.</b> <br>
            <br>
            Outside of academics, I am interested in investigating the intersection of <b>art, media, and technology</b> through 
            mediums such as <b>graphic design, UI/UX, and fashion.</b> At MIT, I am currently involved with Women Business Leaders, 
            Machine Intelligence Community, StartLabs, Infinite Fashion Magazine, and the Mirchi and MissBehavior dance
            teams. Iâ€™m also an avid reader, classically trained pianist, and lover of learning.<br>
