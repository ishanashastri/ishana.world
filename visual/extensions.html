                    I designed and published this printed zine including some of my original digital photography from traveling the world in the past year. This 4.5" x 6"
                    zine features 24 pages of 176 gsm matte paper and is hand-coptic bound with red waxed linen thread. <br><br>

                    This was featured on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJoJSVgoTGy" style="color: peru">Papers Archive's IG</a> and will soon be featured in the first print publication of
                    Papers Archive as well. <br><br>

                    This zine was inspired by Jacopo Benassi's <i>Dying in Venice</i>, where the cover reads the following:
                    <blockquote style="font-style: italic;">
                        "Spending a whole night out in Venice feels like dying and be reborn, better the next day. I photographed what I did
                        not want to photograph, and have not photographed what I wanted to photograph, I photographed to make my way through
                        and get noticed by mice that live in total freedom at night as if they were hamsters or pets. I photographed myself
                        to keep me awake and not to faint in the toilet of the station of Saint Lucia and the benches that lead to the arsenal."
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    No pictures in this zine were taken with the intent of publishing them. I drew inspiration from Benassi to publish the images that 
                    made me uncomfortable: blurry images, too-casual-to-publish images, images of strangers where they noticed I was taking pictures of them,
                    compositionally boring images, etc. This is a naive attempt at accepting that every image I take is an extension of what piques my mind, regardless
                    of whether or not the image itself is compelling. <br><br>
                    
                    I made 25 copes of this zine, 24 of which are now sold. This zine has reached Fukuoka, Japan; Munich, Germany; Cambridge, Massachusetts; Brooklyn, NY; Ann Arbor, MI;
                    Aurora, Colorado; Washington, DC; San Francisco, California; and Chicago, Illinois. <br><br>

                    Huge thank you to <span style="color:peru">GCC Printing</span> in Frederick, MD for printing and cutting the zines.
                    All images were taken on my Canon EOS R6. <br><br>
